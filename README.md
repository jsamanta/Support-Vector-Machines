Using SVMs for classification

Here I will be using a synthethic datasets(Linear and Non linear) for classification using SVM. 
I will be using various hyper-parameters to tune the model such as C, gamma and kernel, that will help to select best support vectors.
Further, I will be using GridSearchCV and BayesSearchCV to select best parameters for the SVC model.
